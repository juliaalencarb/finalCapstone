* **What is the goal of this project?**  This program was done using Python Programming and the built-in math library. This solution helps the user to calculate bond payments and to predict investments returns. It allows the user to choose which calculator they would like to access (e.g. investment calculator or bond calculator) and calculates the outcome for the chosen option, based on details provided by the user.

#### Functions:
* Investment calculator: if the user choose this option, it will prompt the user with questions for specific details to calculate their revenue (e.g. simple or compound interest, interest_rate, amount invested, timespan).
* Bond calculator: if the user choose this option, it will prompt the user with questions for specific details to calculate the monthly amount to be paid (e.g. property value, interest rate, timespan).

#### Usage
This program requires Python 3.11, as previously described. Once the 'finance_calculators.py' is downloaded and executed, the user will be prompted with a menu on the terminal:

</p>

Then, the user should choose an option by typing the referred key word on terminal (e.g. 'bond' or 'investment') and press Enter. Then, after providing the details required by the system, the result will be displayed.
